# A school surveyed studentsâ€™ subject preferences. The three subjects were Mathematics, Science, and
# English. The survey found: 
# Students who like Mathematics: 30
# Students who like Science: 25
# Students who like English: 20
# Students who like both Mathematics and Science: 10
# Students who like both Science and English: 8
# Students who like both Mathematics and English: 7
# Students who like all three subjects: 5
# Write a Python program to draw a Venn Diagram representing this data

# Survey data

# Create the Venn diagram
