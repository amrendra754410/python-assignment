# A city classifies people as neighbors if they live in the same PIN code area. If two people live in the
# same PIN code, they are related.
# Write a Python program that checks if this relation is:
# a) Reflexive: Every person belongs to their own neighborhood.
# b) Symmetric: If A is related to B, then B is related to A.
